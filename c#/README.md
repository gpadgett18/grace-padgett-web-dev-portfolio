Welcome to my c# folder! These apps are set up to use ASP.NET. Both apps are fuctional and may be run in Visual Studio 2022.

The Guitar Shop app implements c# into a web page, and also uses bootstrap for most of the web design. This app has minimal frontend design, and it is more focused on backend functionality. When run, a webpage opens and a few links are displayed. Upon clicking a link, you will be redirected to the correlated webpage.

The Multiform Calculator app is a calculator app with multiple options. It can be used to add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers. This is not a webpage, and I designed the form using Visual Studio. 

Thanks for visiting!
