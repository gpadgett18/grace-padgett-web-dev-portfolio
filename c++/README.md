Thanks for visiting my c++ folder.

The menu calc app displays a menu in the console and asks for a choice. Then it prompt to enter a number for your choice, the price, and an age. After that, the app calculate and displays tax if it is a taxable item, a senior discount if applicable, and the total price. 

The read file app begins by prompting for a file name, which should be entered as scorecard.txt (the file included in the folder). Then it reads the file and finds the high, low, and average score for each player. It displays each player and their scores. If a player is disqualified, it will display the reason.
