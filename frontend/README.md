Thanks for checking out my Frontend folder! It conists of my HTML, CSS, and Javascript code. 

The weather app uses an API to find the weather for the city searched. The app can also get your current location and give you the local weather based on your longitude and latitude. I really enjoyed designing the app to make it visually pleasing and easy to use. 

The file upoad app uses express to display an image you upload from your device. It is a very simple app with minimal design, however I have included it to showw my experience with node js and express.
