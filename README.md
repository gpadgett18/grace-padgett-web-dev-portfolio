Hi, I'm Grace. Welcome to my portfolio!


I've included many apps from different projects and classes. Each outer folder has a README file for more info.

Backend code is organized by coding language, and the frontend folder contains HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

Since express.js is primarily used in backend development, it has a seperate folder.

My mobile dev folder contains a mobile app I created using React Native on Expo. 

If you'd like to see database modeling and SQL scripting, please review my python app. 


Thanks for visiting! Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments.
