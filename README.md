Hi, I'm Grace. Thanks for checking out my work!

I've included many apps from different projects and classes. It's organized by coding language. 

Python: I've decided to display the code from my capstone class. It consists of the backend of a messaging app we were assigned to create. 
I originally was paired with one other backend developer, but that person left the class early on, and I was left to get it done on my own.
As the sole backend developer for the project, and with the professor unfamiliar with python, I had to do a lot of research and testing to find the right solutions.
We were given new tasks every 2 weeks, and a mandatory stand up meeting halfway through each task to give status reports. 
I learned to connect to a PostgreSQL database, read and write data, and return data in the required format. 
I became very familiar with Flask, and also learned how to use Waitress to deploy the backend on a live server. 
I gained a multitude of new teamwork skills, and I attained a newfound sense of confidence in communication while working with the frontend developers.
This project was a huge learning opportunity for me, and I came to love python even more!


I did my best to show my most recent work, but if you'd like to see something more specific, please reach out and I'll be glad to talk about it.
