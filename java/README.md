Welcome to my java apps!


The Dog Creator app creates 3 new dogs and displays their names and weight. The program then compares their weights and displays the comparison. It then displays a new weight for one dog and compares again. This program runs mainly using a user-defined package containing methods. 

The Quotient app starts by displaying a dialogue box explaining the app's function and instructions. After pressing OK, you provde a dividend and then a divisor for the app to divide the equation and display the result.

The Text Animation app displays text in a dialogue box and changes its color and size over the course of a few seconds.
