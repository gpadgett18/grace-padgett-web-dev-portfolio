Welcome to my mobile development folder!

Here is the link to my project if you'd prefer to see it online: https://snack.expo.dev/@gpadgett18/tasky-padgett

I created this mobile app using Expo, and it uses React Native. When opened, a screen with the app name is displayed, and you press the button to continue. Next is the sign in page, where you input a phone number to "sign in", then you are redirected to the task page to create tasks.
