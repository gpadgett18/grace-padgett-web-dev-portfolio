Thanks for checking out my python app!

This python app was a project completed for my capstone course. It is the backend of a messaging app we were assigned to create. 

I originally was paired with one other backend developer, but that person left the class within the first few weeks, and I was left alone on backend. I did communicate and work together with the frontend developers to make our app functional, and in doing so I gained a multitude of teamwork skills. 

The Database used was on a live server which no longer exists, but I have included the model of the database since I designed and added all tables/columns/data myself.

This project was huge learning opportunity for me, and I had to do a lot of my own research and testing to find the right solutions. 

Please reach out if you need any more information!
